## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Knowledge-management-system
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd neo4j-backend
npm install
```

- Create a `.env` file:

  ```env
  ALI_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aliyun_access_key_id
  ALI_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=your_aliyun_access_key_secret
  ALI_APP_KEY=your_aliyun_speech_app_key
  ```

## üè≠ Production Deployment

- Use `pm2`, `docker`, or similar tools to run the backend as a service.
- Build the frontend with `npm run build` and deploy the static files to Nginx, Apache, or cloud hosting.
- Deploy Neo4j separately and secure it properly.
- Keep all keys and configuration files secure in production.
